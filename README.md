#  Dual-loop optimization algorithm for non-convex optimization
This repository implements the dual-loop optimization algorithm from the paper "Over-the-Air Computation via Practical Phase-Shift Reconfigurable Intelligent Surface." The algorithm is designed to handle the coupled optimization variables and practical amplitude-phase coupling constraints inherent in RIS-assisted AirComp systems.
